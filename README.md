# Assembly-PacMan-Game
A quick PacMan inspired game made entirely in MIPS Assembly Language for a PITT Class.  

Took over over 30 hours of blood sweat and tears developing what amounts to Pacman. 

Key take-aways
- file management  
- Code tidiness
- Insane error handling of a language that gives no feedback on issues.
- Patience, lots of patience
